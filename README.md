Overview 
---

This repository contains all my materials associated with my orals exams as a requirement of my PhD in the Department of Sociology at **The Graduate Center, City Univeristy of New York.** My orals covered three topics: _(1) Urban Sociology_ with Greg Smithsimon, _(2) Inequality_ with Leslie McCall, and _(3) Quantitative Methods_ with Jeremy Porter. Jeremy was my chair, which doesn't really mean anything other than they help organize the oral exam and make sure all the members sign the offical paper saying you passed. I felt it was good for me to have a chair with whom I felt comfortable and who I felt was organized.

- some contain a `book review` sub-folder that contains book reviews I found useful. Email me at kzapatka@gradcenter.cuny.edu for a copy

General thoughts
---

I found it very useful to read one section at a time and then summarize the main topics from each reading. I broke each topic into sections, read everything, and then came up with some broad questions. I then spoke with of my committee members (Leslie, Greg, and Jeremy) separately before the exam to go over the list of topics/questions I had prepared in advance. Each professor will have their own way of prepping for the orals exam. They added or subtracted to the list of questions I had prepared. The day of, Greg stuck pretty close to the questions we went over and added a few of his own in as curveballs, Leslie basically asked me her own set of questions but they were very general and were not beyond what I had prepared, and Jeremy let me just talk from the script I had prepared that covered the different quant methods in detail. 

I found my approach to be helpful in organizing my thoughts and then giving myself something to read to jog my memory later. Ideally, you could use these writeups as a literature review or in your dissertation. 

There are lots of different ways to approach your orals exams; another approach might be more suited to your learning style. I know a few other in my department posed a few overarching questions for each section and then used the readings to answer them. In retrospect, this might have been a better approach for me, but I had aleady set my lists when I realized this. 

Happy to talk more about this whenever you want. Just email me.
